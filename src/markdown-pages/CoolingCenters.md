Cooling centers are air-conditioned or cooled buildings designated to provide safe conditions during extreme heat events. These can be municipally owned buildings, community centers, public schools, religious centers, or private businesses. Best practices ensure that cooling center locations and hours are publicized along with extreme heat warnings; remain available in the evenings for vulnerable populations; are accessible to people with disabilities, and by multiple modes of transportation; and operate during the hottest times of day. Providing some simple programming (such as, board games) at cooling centers helps people feel comfortable and engaged. As an alternative, municipalities may decide to open outdoor cooling sites, which typically include public pools, sprinklers, and spraygrounds.

To safely operate cooling centers during the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemic events, the Center for Disease Control recommends best practices such as implementing screening checks, planning for staff absences, and providing prevention supplies such as masks, soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, tissues, and trash baskets.
