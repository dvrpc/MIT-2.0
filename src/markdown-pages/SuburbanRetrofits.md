As population and demographics shift and available land becomes more scarce, there may be an opportunity to re-envision some automobile-oriented, conventional suburbs. Suburban retrofits use rehabilitation, redevelopment, and regreening to transform single-use residential or commercial areas into more compact, walkable, and sustainable mixed-use centers.
