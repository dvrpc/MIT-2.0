Although significant GHG reductions require federal and state leadership, measurable reductions are possible at the local level. Even better, the actions required to reduce GHGs can also benefit municipalities in several ways, including saving taxpayers money, reducing air pollution, promoting economic growth, and improving operations and infrastructure. Municipalities in the DVRPC region have a head start on GHG reduction through DVRPC’s regional GHG inventory, which helps municipalities set a target for GHG reduction and track progress of emissions reductions over time. Many municipalities have taken action by developing energy transition plans and more than 50 municipalities within the region have passed resolutions for 100 percent of energy supplied by renewable sources by 2050.
