Infill development is the recycling of vacant or underutilized land within cities and suburbs. Virtually every community has these types of properties, ranging from single, isolated parcels to surface parking lots to abandoned shopping centers. Compatible residential infill ordinances and infill design guidelines can guide the process of integrating new development carefully into the existing neighborhood fabric with respect to block patterns, scale, building features, landscaping, and other characteristics of the neighborhood.

Greyfields redevelopment involves the redevelopment of abandoned or underutilized shopping centers or strip malls. This redevelopment can often take the form of mixed-use centers and can provide the opportunity to create walkable town centers in communities formerly lacking them.
