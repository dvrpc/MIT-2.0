CBAs are formal agreements between developers and coalitions of community representatives that can build goodwill and offer tangible benefits to both parties. CBAs can take a range of forms, including provisions for affordable units in housing developments, diminishing nuisances, local hiring practices, and financial support to special services districts. Developers benefit from increased community support for their projects, which can help them obtain zoning variances or other desired outcomes.

To be most effective, CBAs should include measurable and achievable objectives, and should be developed through collaboration with a representative coalition of stakeholders. Municipalities can cultivate a climate that encourages CBAs, although they are generally not part of the negotiation process for private agreements, which are made between developers and community representatives.
