Food system planning is the integration of food system issues into policies, plans, and programming at all levels of government. Food system planning aims to facilitate coordination between food system stakeholders through activities like: (1) informing decision making by compiling data; (2) encouraging sustainable food production through plans, policies, and programming; (3) improving healthy food access through zoning, education, and incentives for retail operators; (4) supporting a local or regional food economy; and (5) reducing or reusing food waste.
