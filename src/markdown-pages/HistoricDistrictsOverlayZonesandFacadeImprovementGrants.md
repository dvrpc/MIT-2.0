Historic districts protect historic and/or architecturally significant buildings and resources from being redeveloped in order to preserve a community’s character and forge links to its past. Although prestigious, a building’s listing on the National Register of Historic Places does not protect it from being demolished; that is why it is important for local governments to protect historic resources through zoning ordinances. Overlay zones regulate the development of land and modification of buildings in the area they cover. They are often applied to historic town centers to protect their unique architecture and character. Establishing historical commissions is often necessary to implement local historic preservation efforts.

Façade grant programs, funded through private or public funds, are a way for communities to incentivize reinvestment and/or historic preservation in a geographic area. Most grant programs are targeted at older buildings or long-established businesses but can be used to incentivize new business development on targeted corridors. Some municipalities require grant applications over a certain threshold to undergo review to ensure aesthetic cohesion with the surrounding community.
