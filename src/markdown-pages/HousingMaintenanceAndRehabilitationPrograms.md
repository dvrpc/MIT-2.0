Maintaining an older home can be costly for low-income homeowners, especially the elderly who often rely on fixed incomes. Housing maintenance and rehabilitation programs can help preserve a communityâ€™s existing stock of affordable housing while allowing seniors to stay in their homes longer. Maintenance and rehabilitation programs often feature low-interest loans that can be used for correcting health and safety issues, making plumbing repairs, improving energy conservation, and performing preventive maintenance.
