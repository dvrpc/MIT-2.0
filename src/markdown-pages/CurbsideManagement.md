Curb space is increasingly being stretched to its limits by competing users, including personal vehicle parking, EV charging stations, delivery trucks and vans, taxi and transportation networking company pick-up and drop-off, the creation of bike lanes, bike and scooter parking, green stormwater infrastructure, ADA accessibility improvements, and parklets. Inadequate allocation of space on the curb for deliveries and TNC drop-offs leads to illegal stopping and double-parking, thereby increasing congestion and its externalities. Managing this demand requires that municipalities take an inventory of available curb space, and allocate the space for optimal use, thereby improving mobility for residents, visitors, and business patrons. Management techniques can include regulations on use by time of day, operational strategies, technology, and pricing.
