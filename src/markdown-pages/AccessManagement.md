Access management is the proactive management of vehicular access points to land parcels adjacent to all manner of roadways. Its provisions improve safety and efficiency on roadways by limiting and controlling access points. Access management can reduce congestion and accidents without major capital improvements by linking land use and transportation planning strategies. It may involve shared driveways for local businesses, improved signage, parallel access roads, or similar techniques. Access management can often be accomplished in conjunction with the state department of transportation's Highway Occupancy Permit process.
