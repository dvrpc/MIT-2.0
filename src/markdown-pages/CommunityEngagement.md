Community engagement is a critical part of the planning process, especially at the municipal level. This tool can help create sustainable, desired, and useful projects for the community, convene important stakeholders to support a project, and keep the community informed about development and changes in their area. There are many different community engagement methods that range from low- to high-budget, digital to in-person, small to large, and single-step to multi staged. Which tool municipalities use will depend on the needs and capacity of the stakeholders involved.
