TOD is an approach to planning and building communities around transit stations that enables residents and visitors to drive less while walking, biking, and taking transit more often. TOD zoning, sometimes implemented as an overlay district, can help achieve these outcomes by encouraging a mix of transit-supportive land uses, creating compact development patterns, reducing parking requirements, and prioritizing pedestrian design.
