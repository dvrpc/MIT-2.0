Community-centered design prioritizes public participation and input to create a sustainable, desired, and useful outcome. Using this methodology to integrate school renovation or construction plans into larger community revitalization or redevelopment plans can help create community buy-in and improve the overall well-being of an area. School systems that use community-centered design highlight environmentally sensitive features and sustainable design practices, including efforts to increase walking and biking to school.
