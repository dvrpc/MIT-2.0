Both Pennsylvania and New Jersey have enacted laws that require municipalities to manage stormwater in order to reduce flooding and its various effects, which include erosion, combined sewer overflows, loss of soil from farms, streambank destabilization, and damage to homes, among other problems. The stormwater ordinance sets standards for the practices and techniques that developers must use to keep stormwater runoff on a property for new construction or substantial renovations. These ordinances may include requirements for the use of green stormwater infrastructure techniques to capture stormwater, landscaping features, and the amount of stormwater that must be infiltrated on-site for specific types of storms. Green stormwater infrastructure is an enhanced stormwater management technique that mimics natural processes to store and absorb stormwater near where it falls in urban and built-up environments.
