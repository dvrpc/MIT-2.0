The TRID Act Omnibus Amendments (Act 151) was signed into law by Pennsylvania Governor Wolf on November 4, 2016, updating the the original 2004 TRID law. It offers municipalities, transit agencies, and developers a flexible approach to plan for and implement TOD through the use of value capture strategies. TRID is an optional tool to be used by communities wishing to leverage state funding for planning and implementing TOD. This legislation supports local economic development goals and encourages the use of innovative financing methods, including publicâ€“private partnerships. It also allows transit agencies to share in real estate tax revenues to support capital projects and maintenance in TRID areas.
