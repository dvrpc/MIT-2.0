Local governments regulate businesses in a variety of waysâ€”through building, zoning, licensing, and environmental regulations to name a few. These regulations are essential for protecting businesses, workers, public health, and the quality of life within a community. Development review, however, can present procedural hurdles for businesses if they have become complicated, ineffective, or contradictory with other regulatory rules. To minimize regulatory burdens and streamline the development process, local governments should review their key regulations every few years to evaluate their effectiveness and costs, with an aim of increasing the speed, predictability, and transparency of government decision making. The ability of a business to obtain approval for its development without delay can make a difference in efforts to attract targeted industry employers.
