Dedicated open space funding programs can be set up by municipalities through voter-approved ballot referendums. These programs are validated by direct voter support and raise funds through local real estate taxes, income taxes, and bonding for the express purpose of land preservation through fee-simple land acquisitions and conservation easements. These funds can be used to leverage others from county, state, or federal sources. Dedicated open space funding programs are a proven method for driving successful land preservation efforts at the municipal level.
