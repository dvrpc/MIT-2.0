Right-to-farm provisions can protect farmers from nuisance complaints of odor, noise, and traffic, as long as the farm is in keeping with good management practices. These provisions include Agricultural Security Areas and Agricultural Communities and the Rural Environments Act in Pennsylvania, and “country codes” in New Jersey. Mediations and reviews are often administered by state agriculture development boards.
