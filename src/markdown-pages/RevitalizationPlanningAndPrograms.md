Revitalization plans and programs can be used to help reinvigorate older neighborhood commercial districts and downtowns that are experiencing decline and disinvestment. Local business owners and community-based organizations are often involved and some of the most common priorities include streetscape improvements, infrastructure repair, human capital investments, and commercial district strategies geared toward business support and attraction. Effective revitalization programs have strategic implementation plans with benchmarks, as well as short- and long-term goals and objectives, and include community stakeholders.

Most downtown retail districts often include too much land area. By overzoning for commercial and retail uses, strategic recruitment becomes more difficult. In many cases, smaller districts (one to three blocks) are more successful, as they have less space to fill, and are more walkable.
