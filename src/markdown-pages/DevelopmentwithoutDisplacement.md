As wages continue to fall behind the cost of living and redevelopment raises the cost of rent and property taxes, lower-income residents may be forced to leave their neighborhood for more affordable locations. This can intensify poverty conditions and inhibit economic mobility and access to jobs and transportation options. _Development without Displacement_ is a philosophy aimed at ensuring that new amenities and residents do not price out long-standing residents. This mission is aligned with strategies including advocacy for more affordable housing, community benefits agreements, inclusionary zoning, rent control, just-cause eviction ordinances, taxing vacancies and short-term rentals, and community engagement in the planning and development process.
