Municipalities can play a significant role in supporting or encouraging the development of solar energy in their communities. Municipalities can encourage solar energy development through implementing supportive zoning and permitting processes, training staff on best practices, and supporting community education on best practices in alternative energy (solar, wind, hydro) implementation. There are 16 local governments, plus DVRPC, who have received SolSmart designation, which requires a solar ordinance.
