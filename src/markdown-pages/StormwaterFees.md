A stormwater fee is levied upon all properties in a municipality to fund the collection of stormwater from those properties, and to mitigate the pollution generated by that stormwater runoff. Most municipalities in southeastern Pennsylvania have the authority to levy a stormwater fee. A stormwater fee may be administered by a stormwater utility, although one is not required in most Pennsylvania municipalities to collect the fee.

Stormwater fees are typically low for residential customers; anywhere from $2 to $20 per month. Fees for commercial and institutional properties are usually based on the amount of impervious surface contained. Unlike taxes, stormwater fees apply to all properties in a community, including tax-exempt ones. The revenue generated by a stormwater fee is dedicated to installing and maintaining stormwater infrastructure, and to installing green stormwater infrastructure to capture and absorb stormwater close to where it falls.
