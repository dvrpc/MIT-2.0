The quality and cost of skilled labor are critical factors in business site selection. Therefore, many local and state governments have made workforce attraction and development top priorities. Communities can become more attractive by providing customized training programs and hiring assistance. Communities can encourage new companies to hire locally, thereby ensuring that wages will be spent in the community. This can be done through a formalized local hiring program or community benefits agreements.
