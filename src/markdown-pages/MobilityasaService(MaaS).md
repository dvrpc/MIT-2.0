MaaS combines multiple transportation modes with monthly subscriptions or other payment plans, and operates as an integrated network with transit, walking, and biking as integral components. A multimodal web application that connects to different service providers sits at the heart of a MaaS network, and combines existing and emerging modes with digital technologies. A MaaS app can identify the best available mode for each trip using real-time travel information and simplifies payment across service providers.

MaaS has the potential to change the current personal vehicle transportation model from vehicle ownership to pay-per-use and monthly subscriptions. Successfully bringing about such a network will require a broadly supportive governance framework and policy environment. Key supportive policies include building protected bike lanes, dedicated parking for bikes and scooters (including at transit stations), allowing transit riders to carry bikes on board trains and subways, building multimodal transportation transfer hubs, slowly increasing residential parking permit cost, curb management, and ensuring historically underserved communities and individuals with disabilities have equal or better access to the MaaS network. A complete regulatory framework needs to address permitting operators, equipment and safety standards, data sharing, and equity for underserved communities. In addition, governments should reduce barriers to entry, promote open access to data and advanced programming interfaces, and provide public oversight of new servicesâ€”even in advance of regulations. As new services emerge, regulations will need to be reviewed, and possibly updated, more frequently. Outdated regulations risk slowing innovation or failing to adequately protect service providers, users, and others.
