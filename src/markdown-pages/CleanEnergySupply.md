Energy use accounts for the vast majority (88.2 percent) of GHG emissions in the DVRPC region. Achieving the region’s GHG reduction goal relies on a combination of energy efficiency, conservation, electrification, and cleaner energy sources. Renewable energy sources ( wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear power) are expected to play an increasingly important role in the future of our region's energy mix. Benefits to renewable energy include reduced GHG emissions, fewer local air pollutants, more jobs added to the regional economy, and more stable energy prices. There are many ways in which municipalities can increase renewable energy generation, use, and access. These include procuring from renewable energy sources, establishing purchase power agreements, creating community-shared solar programs (not yet legal in Pennsylvania), and zoning to assist in production of clean energy, as well as pilot microgrids and clean heating projects.
