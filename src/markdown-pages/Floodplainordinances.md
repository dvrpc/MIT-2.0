Floodplain Management Ordinances establish development and land use standards that minimize the risk to life and property from floods and help to maintain the natural functions of floodplains from the adverse effects of excessive development. Floodplain Management Ordinances also ensure that communities take flood hazards into account in all official actions relating to land management and use.
