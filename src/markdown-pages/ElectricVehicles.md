EVs have significant environmental, health, and cost benefits over conventional gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. Because EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, they reduce the public’s exposure to harmful emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has shown that a typical EV produces fewer GHGs and harmful pollutants over the lifecycle of the vehicle. EVs have also been shown to save the owner money through lower fuel and maintenance costs.

Regulations—ranging from parking restrictions to safety and building codes—will need to be updated to the deployment of EV charging infrastructure, known as Electric Vehicle Service Equipment. The passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has allocated funding toward enhancing the nation’s charging infrastructure on public and private property to support the growing number of EVs and decrease range anxiety.

Local governments can also lead on EVs by procuring them for municipal-owned fleets. A fleet vehicle audit takes an inventory of current fleet vehicles and driving practices to determine where the best opportunities lie for reducing energy use in fleet vehicles. A fleet audit will assess the availability, costs, benefits, and barriers to implementation of alternative fuels and vehicles, and will help identify other fuel-saving opportunities, such as improvements to the existing fleet through vehicle maintenance and the feasibility of an early retirement program.
