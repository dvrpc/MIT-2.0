_Missing Middle Housing_ refers to a range of multiunit or clustered housing types, such as duplexes, courtyard apartments, and townhouses, that are compatible in scale with single-family homes. When properly designed, these housing types can diversify a communityâ€™s housing stock, support local retail, offer more affordable housing units,and meet the growing demand for walkable urban living. Although these housing types can help bridge the gap between detached single-family homes and mid-rise apartments, they often do not fit neatly into conventional density-based zoning codes.
