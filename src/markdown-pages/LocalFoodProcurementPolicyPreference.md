Local governments can establish procurement policy preferences for local food businesses to support local farmers, processors, and food businesses, thereby circulating money within the local economy. The municipal procurement process can stipulate a preference for goods or commodities produced in-state. It can indicate whether that preference is specific to food or agricultural products and, if so, how those terms are defined. Next, it can indicate whether the preference applies to local agencies or school districts. Finally, it can categorize the preference given to food grown in-state.

Municipalities can also sponsor farmers’ markets and Community-Supported Agriculture pick-up sites, buy local food on an ad-hoc basis for special events, and make public land available for community gardens.
