Designated minority and women-owned businesses are eligible for public and private grants and loans, as well as specialized programs aimed to mitigate the effects of long-term systemic discriminatory practices. Local governments can support minority- and women-owned businesses by evaluating their contractor bidding processes to ensure that they do not create additional barriers for smaller or less-established businesses. Slow-moving procurement payment timelines, for example, can disproportionately affect these businesses. Specialized programs, online resources, and networking opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses can offer further support through capacity-building and increased visibility.
