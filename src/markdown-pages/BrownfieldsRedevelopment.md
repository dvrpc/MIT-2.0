Brownfields are sites whose use, development, or modification are complicated by the presence, or perceived presence, of contamination. Brownfields can include former industrial sites, gas stations, dry cleaners, and even farms that have stored pesticides or fertilizers. These sites can contribute to neighborhood blight and—depending on contamination levels—to public health problems. The redevelopment of brownfields can provide many benefits to a community, including an increased tax base, an opportunity for new jobs, the utilization of existing infrastructure, the removal of blight, and most importantly, improve the environment. The USEPA provides grants and resources for assessments to local communities and counties.
