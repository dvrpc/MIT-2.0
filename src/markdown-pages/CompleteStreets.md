Complete streets are planned, designed, operated and maintained to enable safe, convenient and comfortable transportation by users of all ages and abilities and modes—walking, cycling, driving automobiles, riding public transportation, and delivering goods. Complete Streets design standards make roads safer and more user friendly by including wide sidewalks, bicycle lanes, raised crosswalks and medians, audible traffic signals, bus pullouts, and any other design elements that support a safe, multimodal transportation network. Complete Streets also provide adequate space for goods movement and delivery, and include sustainable measures to treat stormwater runoff and minimize or eliminate water accumulation at intersections or other points along the street. To make room for multiple modes, municipalities may pursue road diets. The remaining pavement width from the eliminated lane(s) can be converted into bicycle lanes, sidewalks, on-street parking, or some combination of these elements.

NJDOT was among the first state departments of transportation to adopt an internal Complete Streets policy for all new and retrofit transportation facilities funded through their Capital Program. Camden, Mercer, Montgomery, Chester, and Burlington counties have county-wide policies, and every municipality in Mercer County has a Complete Streets policy.

In Pennsylvania, PennDOT Connects includes Complete Streets in the department’s proposal screening process. It includes checklist items to screen for projects that improve safety, mobility, and accessibility for all users.
