The CLG Program is a partnership between local governments, the National Park Service and state historic preservation offices to jointly protect a communityâ€™s historic character. Once certified, CLGs become an active partner in the Federal Historic Preservation Program and gain access to benefits of the program, including funding, technical assistance, and other resources. States are required to give at least 10 percent of their funding to CLGs as subgrants, which can fund a wide variety of projects, including surveys, National Register nominations, rehabilitation work, design guidelines, educational programs, training, structural assessments, and feasibility studies. Communities that preserve their historic character have higher property values, less population decline, more walkability, and a greater sense of community.
