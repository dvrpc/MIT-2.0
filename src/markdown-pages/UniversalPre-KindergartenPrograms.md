Universal pre-K programs ensure that all families can access free, high-quality early childhood education. In addition to preparing children for a lifetime of learning, these programs offer important benefits for social and emotional development. Universal pre-K programs help remediate childcare issues, making it more feasible for parents to work full- or part-time, a benefit that is felt particularly strongly in single-parent (or caregiver) households. Given that children from lower-income households are least likely to attend preschool and most likely to benefit from it, these programs can provide a large impact.

The term universal pre-K can refer to programs that offer seats to all students in a school district, or to programs that are not targeted to a particular group or community but are open to all. Although many municipalities have made progress toward increasing access, universal pre-K programs are most commonly achieved as part of a longer process that requires a higher level of investment but provides other important benefits to children and their families.
