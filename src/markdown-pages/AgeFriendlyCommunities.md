Age-friendly communities are places where both the young and old can move about safely and enjoyably. Planning for age-friendly communities means that every resident has the right to participate in decision making; access to high-quality public spaces; and safe, comfortable transportation options.

Flexible and varied housing supports age-friendly communities. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are small secondary units located on single-family lots, either as separate, unattached structures or as apartments within the envelope of a property’s primary structure. Because of their size and placement on existing lots, they provide affordable homes for fixed-income households (including seniors) that are close to family, friends, or other potential caregivers. In addition to ADUs, municipalities should make sure their zoning ordinances allow shared housing by unrelated adults. Often, this can be regulated by the number of adults allowed, and care should be taken to remove any undue restrictions. Communities can be made more age-friendly in a variety of other ways, such as age-friendly business programs, universal design standards, meeting Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility requirements, and ridesharing partnerships for seniors without smartphones; and adding sidewalks, bus shelters, benches, access to public restrooms, connected streets, places to sit and rest, and drinking water fountains.
