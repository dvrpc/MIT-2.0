TIDs aim to increase the number of overnight visitors using businesses and services in a designated area. TIDs are formed through a public–private partnership between the local government and the businesses in a district. TID funds are usually managed by a non-profit convention and visitors' bureau, hotel association, or similar destination marketing organization. Typical TID services include marketing programs to raise awareness of the destination, sponsorship of special events that attract overnight visitors, and sales programs to bring in large-group business.
