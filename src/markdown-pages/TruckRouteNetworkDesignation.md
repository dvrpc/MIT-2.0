Local governments can use their control over land use and zoning decisions to lay the groundwork for a delivery-friendly city; one where deliveries are executed in ways that are equally conducive and sensitive to business interests as they are to local communities. Municipalities that are concerned with how truck traffic impacts the local community are encouraged to work with their county planning offices, DVRPC, and state departments of transportation to designate truck routes. Designating specific truck routes can make them more reliable for truck drivers, safer for other road users, and help to ensure that adequate considerations are made to mitigate negative impacts of truck activity. Enhancing the links between freight-related transportation and land use by maintaining existing industrial centers, and continuing to promote and support freight centers can further support the economy while mitigating truck traffic and its externalities.
