Agricultural zoning allows municipalities to protect rural and agricultural areas by encouraging agriculture as a primary use, and by establishing large minimum lot sizes, usually of 20 acres or more. More developed areas may also protect agricultural uses by amending their zoning codes to permit community gardens and urban agriculture in existing zoning districts. Zoning should also allow for the diversification of uses and activities on agricultural lands, such as tours, farmstays, and weddings. Doing so will enable farmers to capitalize on trends like agritourism to subsidize more traditional activities like food production.
